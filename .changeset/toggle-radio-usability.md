Rebuild Toggle as a native radio group on the usx-toggle list, with keyboard focus, touch-sized button labels, disabled states, and accessible names for icon choices. Use stable generated React IDs and caller-provided Django group IDs. Fix controlled/default value precedence and preserve numeric values, including zero. Add ariaLabel, required, and React onChange metadata. Update stories with a controlled example and keyboard checks, and remove rendered Django whitespace that shifted the buttons.

Toggle labels use usa-button/usx-button primary styling for the selected radio and the shared Button ghost styling for unselected radios, while retaining native checked-state and form-reset behavior. Custom button styles can target usx-toggle__button.
